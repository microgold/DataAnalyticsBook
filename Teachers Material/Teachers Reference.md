### **Python Challenges**

#### **Challenge 1: Implement Data Minimization**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a dataset with multiple columns, create a Python function that identifies and retains only the columns necessary for a specific analysis task. Remove columns containing unnecessary personally identifiable information (PII).  

**Solution**:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Email': ['alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com', 'charlie@example.com'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'Purchase_Amount': [120.5, 150.75, 80.2],
    'Region': ['North', 'South', 'East']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Function to minimize data
def minimize_data(df, required_columns):
    """
    Retains only the columns specified in the required_columns list.

    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): Original dataset.
        required_columns (list): List of columns to retain.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: Minimized dataset with only required columns.
    """
    return df[required_columns]

# Specify columns needed for analysis
required_columns = ['Age', 'Purchase_Amount', 'Region']

# Minimized dataset
minimized_df = minimize_data(df, required_columns)
print("Minimized Dataset:")
print(minimized_df)
```

**Expected Output**:
```plaintext
Minimized Dataset:
   Age  Purchase_Amount Region
0   25          120.50  North
1   30          150.75  South
2   35           80.20   East
```

#### **Challenge 2: Detect Duplicate Entities Using Hashed Identifiers**
**Problem Statement**:  
Given a dataset with customer details, use hashing to anonymize names and detect duplicate entities based on hashed identifiers.  

**Solution**:
```python
import hashlib

# Sample dataset with duplicates
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice Johnson', 'Bob Smith', 'Alice Johnson', 'Charlie Brown'],
    'Email': ['alice.j@example.com', 'bob.smith@example.com', 'alice.j@example.com', 'charlie.b@example.com'],
    'Purchase_Amount': [120.50, 150.75, 80.20, 50.10]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Hashing function
def hash_identifier(value):
    """
    Hashes a given value using SHA-256.
    
    Parameters:
        value (str): The value to be hashed.
        
    Returns:
        str: Hashed value.
    """
    return hashlib.sha256(value.encode()).hexdigest()

# Apply hashing to anonymize Name and Email
df['Name_Hashed'] = df['Name'].apply(hash_identifier)
df['Email_Hashed'] = df['Email'].apply(hash_identifier)

# Detect duplicates based on hashed identifiers
df['Is_Duplicate'] = df.duplicated(subset=['Name_Hashed', 'Email_Hashed'], keep=False)

print("Dataset with Hashed Identifiers and Duplicates:")
print(df[['Name_Hashed', 'Email_Hashed', 'Purchase_Amount', 'Is_Duplicate']])
```

**Expected Output**:
```plaintext
Dataset with Hashed Identifiers and Duplicates:
                                         Name_Hashed  \

0          True  
1         False

### Python Challenges with Solutions:

#### **Challenge 1**: Find the Top 5 Most Popular Movies
Write a Python function that calculates the top 5 movies with the highest number of ratings from the merged MovieLens dataset.

**Solution**:
```python
import pandas as pd

def top_5_popular_movies(merged_df):
    # Count the number of ratings per movie
    rating_counts = merged_df.groupby('title')['rating'].count().sort_values(ascending=False)
    # Return the top 5 movies
    return rating_counts.head(5)

# Example usage
ratings_df = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')
movies_df = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
merged_df = pd.merge(ratings_df, movies_df, on='movieId')
print(top_5_popular_movies(merged_df))
```

**Expected Output (Example)**:
```
title
Pulp Fiction (1994)                 325
Forrest Gump (1994)                 311
Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)    308
Jurassic Park (1993)                294
Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)    290
Name: rating, dtype: int64
```

#### **Challenge 2**: Recommend Similar Movies
Implement a function to recommend 5 movies similar to a given movie title using cosine similarity of genres.

**Solution**:
```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def recommend_similar_movies(movie_title, movies_df):
    # One-hot encode genres
    genre_dummies = movies_df['genres'].str.get_dummies('|')
    # Compute similarity matrix
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(genre_dummies)
    
    # Get the index of the given movie
    try:
        idx = movies_df[movies_df['title'] == movie_title].index[0]
    except IndexError:
        return "Movie not found in dataset."
    
    # Get similarity scores for the movie
    similarity_scores = list(enumerate(similarity_matrix[idx]))
    # Sort and get top 5 similar movies (excluding itself)
    sorted_scores = sorted(similarity_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[1:6]
    # Extract movie titles
    similar_movies = [movies_df.iloc[i[0]]['title'] for i in sorted_scores]
    return similar_movies

# Example usage
movies_df = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
print(recommend_similar_movies("Toy Story (1995)", movies_df))
```

**Expected Output (Example)**:
```
['Antz (1998)', 'Toy Story 2 (1999)', 'Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, The (2000)', "Emperor's New Groove, The (2000)", 'Monsters, Inc. (2001)']
```
