## **Getting Started**

### **1. Install Python and Essential Libraries**

This book relies heavily on Python and data analytics libraries. Follow these steps to get set up:

1. **Download Python**: Install the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Jupyter Notebook** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn torch
   ```

### **2. Accessing Datasets and Code**

The datasets and Python code used in this book are hosted on Kaggle and included as Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files). You can:

1. **Create a Kaggle Account**: Sign up for a free account at [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/).
2. **Download Datasets**: Use links provided in each chapter to access datasets directly from Kaggle.
3. **Open Notebooks in Kaggle**: Upload the provided .ipynb files to Kaggle or run them directly in Kaggle’s free online editor.

Alternatively, you can download the notebooks and run them locally using Jupyter Notebook.
